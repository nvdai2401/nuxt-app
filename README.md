## Deployment to Vercel

### Option 1: Deploy from Git

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel
3. Vercel will detect Nuxt and use the optimal settings
4. Your site will be deployed automatically

### Option 2: Deploy using Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Run the deployment command:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to log in and configure your deployment

The application uses the configuration in `vercel.json` for optimal deployment settings.

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
